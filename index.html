            <h1>Pokémon: Starters Adventure</h1>
            <p>In this game, you play as 3 different Pokémon. The goal of the game is to defeat as many Pokémon as possible! </p>
            <p>To defeat an incoming Pokémon, press spacebar. You will shoot out an attack. </p>
            <p>But that attack will be of the same type as your Pokémon.</p>
            <p>So if you use a fire Pokémon, you will shoot a fire attack.</p>
            <p>The only way to defeat an incoming Pokémon, is to hit it with an attack that has an advantage to that Pokémon's type!</p>
