# Creating a ~~Paarthurnax~~ Parallax effect
**In short**: I will be creating a platform/endless runner game.
And now in *not so short:*

The goal of this assignment is to create a multi-layered parallax effect, with our own fun little twist on it.
Different layers need to move at different speeds, the first (the ground) is the fastest, while the last layer (the sky) is the slowest.
Images have already been given to us by the coaches, but we're free to create/find our own images if we so desire.
These are the must-have requirements of this assignment.

- A page with a moving background that looks natural
- Something of your personal choosing to enhance the page, go take a look at the suggestions or come up with something yourself!

One of the suggestions the coaches gave us is to create a platform game/endless runner.
And that's precisely what I will be aiming for.

**So in short one more time**: I will be creating a platform/endless runner game.

## To-Do List
- [x] Add basic code structure (HTML, CSS and JS)
- [x] Add all images given to us by coaches
  - [ ] This can be changed later on
- [ ] Do some research on the parallax effect
- [ ] And some research on the multi-layered parallax effect
- [ ] Big Goal #1: Create 1 layer of the parallax effect
  - [ ] Think/plan out some smaller, attainable goals
  - [ ] Make sure it's infinite
