# Pokémon Emerald: The Platform Game


## Creating a ~~Paarthurnax~~ Parallax effect
**In short**: I will be creating a platform/endless runner game.
And now in *not so short:*

The goal of this assignment is to create a multi-layered parallax effect, with our own fun little twist on it.
Different layers need to move at different speeds, the first (the ground) is the fastest, while the last layer (the sky) is the slowest.
Images have already been given to us by the coaches, but we're free to create/find our own images if we so desire.
These are the must-have requirements of this assignment.

- A page with a moving background that looks natural
- Something of your personal choosing to enhance the page, go take a look at the suggestions or come up with something yourself!

One of the suggestions the coaches gave us is to create a platform game/endless runner.
And that's precisely what I will be aiming for.

**So in short one more time**: I will be creating a platform/endless runner game.

## To-Do List
- [x] Add basic code structure (HTML, CSS and JS)
- [x] Add all images given to us by coaches
  - [ ] This can be changed later on
- [x] Do some research on the parallax effect
- [x] And some research on the multi-layered parallax effect
- [x] Add favicon
- [x] Big Goal #1: Get images for the Pokémon Game for the Parallax background
  - [x] Grass
  - [x] Clouds
  - [x] Sea
  - [x] Sky
  - [x] Trees (from other Pokémon game)
  - Flying Pokémon
    - Might just add Latios flying, and when it hits something it explodes (Spongebob Style)
  - Once I start in canvas, I need to remember that the pixels of the images are 960 / 600
- [ ] Create parallax effect with Pokémon assets
  - [x] Add Canvas in HTML
  - [x] Style Canvas in CSS
  - [ ] Start out by just looping/animating one part/one asset
  - [ ] Once one part of parallax is done, do the same for the other parts
  - [ ] When parallax effect works -> double check on github if it works properly!
  - [ ] ...
  - [ ] Make sure it keeps looping
  - [ ] OOP - Create a class called "BackgroundAnimation" (name may be changed in the future)
    - This is needed to give different properties to every 'BackgroundAnimation' object (assets)


## Lettuce Learn Canvas
While doing my research on this assignment (asking questions to Google, a magic 8-ball and my mom who knows nothing about coding), I stumbled upon something called canvas.
Then I found [an interesting video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg7ibYWhjPI) that delves more into this subject.
I've never used canvas before, so I really want to try it out and learn in during this assignment.

## Name of the game: Pokémon!!
The very first Pokémon game I ever played was Pokémon Emerald.
So I have a strong emotional connection to it.
That's why I chose to create a platform game with a parallax effect using the sprites/art from that game.
During the intro, there was a scene of the main characters riding their bikes with their Pokémon.
I want to use this as background for the parallax effect, and maybe add some other stuff to enhance the parallax experience as well.

I used a free, alternative version to split up all the elements of the image you that I just showed.
It's called [photopea.com](https://www.photopea.com/) and it was a lifesaver!
I do think I might have spent too much time on making it look good and not enough on actually programming, that is something I'm afraid of.
But on the other hand, if it looks cool I can be more proud of it so it was 100% worth it to invest that time in the images.
